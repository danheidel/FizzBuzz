FizzBuzz objects.

fizzbuzzmodule.js instantiates a single FizzBuzz testing object.  It is instantiated with an array of key/value pair objects which construct the filter.  Test code is included which runs when run in node.

fizzbuzzconstructor allows construction of FizzBuzz testing objects.  Like the previous example, it can be instantiated with a filter or have one applied later.

fizzbuzzobject.js is an unsuccessfull attempt to do the same with a more generic JS pattern.
